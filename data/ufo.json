The crafts must have been USA airplanes or from earth since both had a red light on top.  Odd thing is that they were totally silent even though 500 feet above ground and about the width of 2 city blocks away traveling fast.  Since they were heading toward me could explain that I could only see bright lights.  This could have been their head lights.  However, why would anyone trying to conceal their identity travel with all lights on and a red light on top ?  Also the next morning the beach coastline had fishermen and their SUVs all side by side in front of my house.  Fish run in August I thought even though some people have told me that the fish run in late October.  That night I saw a shooting star that headed in the direction of where those 2 UFOs came from.  So another ship may have joined them or was trying to hook up with them.  I read another report that someone else further down the Barrier Island where I saw this als! o saw a UFO 2 nights earlier.  I think someone should check Island Beach to see if any ships landed there.  Probably too difficult since it is all bush or brush and sand which the wind and ocean could easily cover the landing marks.  There is also many marsh areas to easily cover landing marks.  My hunch is that there crafts were from Earth,  However, the unanswered question is why them did the 2 crafts travel so fast so low and so silently ?

No plane flies this fast.\n    \nI also live in Boise, Idaho and have seen these lights as well on numerous occasions.

They are not always traveling from the Southwest to the Northeast.  Over a period of about two years I have seen these same objects, and I have also witnessed them traveling from due South, to due North.  I have also seen them bend their trajectory, and alter their velocity from slow to very fast.  These objects appear at first as a very bright white light, (sometimes amber in color), and appear to be intelligently controlled.  They travel along at a steady velocity, and then fade in their intensity, then just simply blink out and disappear.

My balcony faces a large open area where the appartment swimming pool is located.  \nAs I was lighting my cigarette, I noticed something coming from over the building on my right.  It was only about three or four feet wide and rectangular, almost a perfect square.  It had a dull red appearance. \nIt moved by me pretty fast only about twenty or so feet in front of me.  It looked like it came from over the building, it dipped down in front of me, and started rising pretty fast.  \nNormally, on a windy texas night i wouldn't have thought much about that, but it moved in a straight line, and was definately three dimensional.  \nAs i mentioned before, it was moving pretty fast and flew by me as i was lighting my cig.  I kept watching it and it changed direction and started going skyward, again it was moving in a completly straight line.  Only once it got some altitude and some distance did it start to get a white glow to it, and i was able to follow it in the sky for quite awhile, definatly longer than i should have for an object of that size.  \nBy this time i was trying to figure out what in Heavens name this thing was.  It couldn't have been paper, since in the wind paper wouldn't have kept its shape, and plus it was a complete square.  It couldn't have been a box, since the wind wasn't THAT strong, and again it would have been knocked around instead of moving in a straight line.  Plus, boxes don't glow.  \nAs i mentioned before, i followed it for quite awhile, i smoked the majority of my cigarette watching it, and then it just dissappeared.  \nI noticed a plane was in the sky on an intercept course to the object, and when it dissapeared, the plane changed course.  \nI live near an Air Force base and i wonder if the plane was a military plane.\nIf anyone has had a similar experiance, I would like to hear about, partly just to confirm my sanity.\nWitness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We arrived at the summit around 4:30 a.m.  It was cold and extremely windy.  There were already a few tour shuttles that had arrived, and approximately six or seven other cars that had arrived. I got out of the car to use the restroom at the visitor’s center and looked around a bit.  It was pitch dark, and, since it was way too early for the sunrise, I went back to the car to keep warm.\nOur car was parked approximately 15-20 yards from the visitor’s center and the accompanying railing constructed there, along which people stand, facing east, to view the sunrise.\nOnce I was back in our car, I noticed a strange white glow emanating from the area of the visitor’s center or just beyond it (to the south/southeast). From my perspective, sitting in our vehicle, it looked like a half-circle or dome of white light illuminating the area of the mountain just on the other side of the viewing railing and extending above approximately two stories high. So, relatively close by. The defined outer edge of the “dome” was distinctly brighter than the interior. The interior was translucent but very white. The outer edge made a sharp, bright, distinct border.\nI wondered if it was some sort of pre-dawn phenomenon having to do with the moon, or the coming sun, and the clouds. I said to my husband, “Look at that dome of white light over by the visitor’s center. What is that?” But he was already dozing off, resting after the somewhat challenging drive to the summit in the pitch dark.\nI very much wanted to get out and take a closer look. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before. But my desire to stay out of the extreme wind and cold won over, and I continued to view it from inside the car. I nodded off, since we’d gotten up at 2am to make the drive from the Ka’anapali Beach area to the summit. I napped for about 45 minutes, after which time my husband and I got out of the car to position ourselves amongst the gathering crowd to view the sunrise.  I did not even remember seeing the white light…  …until, three days later, after boarding our flight home from Maui, we struck up a conversation with the man sitting next to me on the plane, and discovered that he and his wife had also gone to the summit of Haleakala on September 23rd to see the sunrise.  And he said to us, “Did you see a mysterious white light when you were there, while it was still dark?” To which I replied, “YES!” I’d forgotten all about it until he mentioned it. From his perspective, when he saw the light (I believe he said he was standing outside when he saw it), he observed a complete circle hovering in the air. I don’t recall him mentioning how nearby it seemed, or how high above ground he thought it was. His description matched mine in that he said it had a white translucent center and a bright, sharp, defined outside edge. He said he’d been searching the Internet for an explanation of what it could have been, but without much success, as he wasn’t sure what phrases to search on; it was so difficult! to describe.\nI finally got around to doing my own Internet search on this phenomenon last Friday (October 4). That’s when I found this web site.","Lights on object":true,"Aura or haze around object":true,"Aircraft nearby":null,"Animals reacted":null,"Left a trail":null,"Emitted other objects":null,"Changed Colo":null,"Emitted beams":null,"Location details":null,"Changed Color":null,"Electrical or magnetic effects":null,"Explanation":null,"Possible abduction":null,"Missing Time":null,"Marks found on body afterwards":null,"Landed":null},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":19,"row":{"Sighting":137935,"Occurred":"2017-12-21 17:57:00 Local","Location":"Beaverton, OR, USA","Shape":"Formation","Duration":"10 minutes","No of observers":1.0,"Reported":"2017-12-21 20:06:00 Pacific","Posted":"2018-01-12 00:00:00","Summary":"Several stationary flashing lights were observed hovering over Hillsboro near the airport, Hillsboro Stadium area.

A lot of time has passed, but it was one of those moments that get seared into one's mind forever.  I would like to give some background information and describe my experience as best as I can recall it.\nOn a summer evening in late August, my friend, mother and I were laying outside in our yard on our trampoline.  It may have been around 11 to midnight as it was most definitely dark, and the sun would not have set until 9:15pm that time of year.  We were idly stargazing and chatting as we often did.  We lived near rural Ida, Michigan, (an agricultural community in southeast Michigan, about an hour south of Detroit, near the Ohio border) and did not have a lot of light pollution so stargazing was a normal summer evening past time.\nI would often track commercial airlines and  watch  the horizons because where we lived is defined by very flat, treeless farmland and uninterrupted views could be see in any direction.  Plane spotting was easy as we seemed to live under the flight path of the Detroit Metro Airport, and would very often view low flying commercial aircraft circling over our house.  So I am very familiar with viewing planes at night.\nOn that evening, however, I recall quietly talking, and not really paying attention to anything particular in the sky.  However, I remember all at once immediately realizing that I could not see the stars up above me.  It was a clear night.  I recall sitting up in the trampoline, looking up and seeing a mass in the air above our yard that was large enough to seem to sit over the entire property as it passed, which was around ¾ of an acre.  I could tell it was a triangular mass only by lights on three points.  I generally recall that they were not too bright, yet also illuminated the ground around us below.  It was low, seemingly floating just barely over the top of our barn and farmhouse, however, since I did regularly experience those low flying planes that were waiting to land, I knew it only seemed to be that low.  What was most eerie about the encounter that the flying mass seemed to make little or no noise.  It glided almost over like a helium float, but in a controlled and steady fashion.  I recall there being something like a low pulse hum, but I don't remember it being loud, like if I had been in the house or if there was traffic noise etc, I may not have noticed it at all.\nThe mass headed in a southern direction.  However, I did not watch it to see where it went.  To be honest, my friend and I were scared out of our minds and as soon as it directly overhead us, I remember fleeing to our house in sheer terror, dragging my mother along, who was laying tummy down and didn't notice it right away (which tells you how quiet it was).  I was very freaked out, as the 90's was hooked on X-Files and crop signs, but I don't ever remember feeling it was alien.  It's hard to explain, but even though I couldn't explain it, and I feared it, I felt it was military or something.\nThe only thing I can't quite remember is, is if there was a center light.  I feel like I remember there being a cooler light in the center of the mass, but I am not entirely sure as I only acutely remember the three lights making the triangular shape.\nI never again saw an object like that fly in the skies where we lived.  Although, I did note lights that would seem like satellites in the sky, (bright, no twinkle) but would stop and start movement in the sky in unpredictable patterns.  And when they move, I would get light interference in radio signals.  (I would often wear headphones and listen to fm radio on my Walkman if I was stargazing alone).  I noted these most often in western skies and off and on over several years.  I don't know if this was related.","Lights on object":true,"Aura or haze around object":null,"Aircraft nearby":null,"Animals reacted":null,"Left a trail":null,"Emitted other objects":null,"Changed Colo":null,"Emitted beams":null,"Location details":null,"Changed Color":null,"Electrical or magnetic effects":null,"Explanation":null,"Possible abduction":null,"Missing Time":null,"Marks found on body afterwards":null,"Landed":null},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":22,"row":{"Sighting":83765,"Occurred":"1999-01-24 20:00:00 Local","Location":"Portland, OR, USA","Shape":"Oval","Duration":"120 seconds","No of observers":0.0,"Reported":"2011-09-07 18:24:58 Pacific","Posted":"2011-10-10 00:00:00","Summary":"Huge UFO passing between opening over the city of Portland, Oregon","Text":"Coming down OHSU Hospital in Portland, Oregon which is on a hill above the city.  It was winter and the sky was clouded and grey, but there was like an opening between the clouds and below it you could see the city lights.  It was about 8 PM on a Sunday night.  As I was going down the hill, looking at the city, suddenly a huge, immense, flying object started passing almost in front of me, and on top of the city.  I stop the car in the middle of the road as I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was flying low, so low I could see how huge it was.  Unbelievable... it was almost at the bottom of the heavy clouds passing the opening in the sky.  I could see it passing, like in slow motion, like almost hoovering, without making any noise, nothing.  It was in a tilt position, like a dish, a plate... Huge, immense,like a football field,looked round but it was so big it could have been oval because the border of the tilt make me feel it was round or oval, looked heavy, the color was clear grey metalic but it was not shiny, on the tilted side I could see, there where four roads of blinking lights, like the christmas lights. I didn't see the top because it was tilted, only the bottom and the lights around the side. After being in my car looking at this scenario, I decided to walk outside the vehicle, to see if someone else was seeing it. But when I stepped out and looked at the sky, the flying object had dissapeared.\nI returned to the hospital as I was so impressed... I told my story to the ER doctors I work with and everyone believe me.  I was told they see things like that all the time.  For me was the first and the last.  I called the Air Force, the TV stations, the airport, but no one give me any attention.  I do believe that I saw a UFO, I think I was fortunate to see something like that in my life.  It was too wide and too long, and absolutely quiet to be anything I have ever seen.  It was not an airplane or a flying globe.

A couple of second later, another series of 5 lights came on in the same manner slightly higher and to the right of the first set of lights. These lights were orangish-yellow, with the look of a lantern, or firelight.  They were perfectly clylindrical, with no tails or streaks of any kind.

I am a retired 29 year Navy vet with heavy aviation background. It was just before official twilight time. As we were heading North on Compton Bridge Rd I noticed off to my right at about 030, my 1330 o'clock relative position, a single light in the sky and roughly 15 degrees above the horizon. Being a licensed pilot and having spent much time flying and in and around airplanes and airports I thought it was just a aircraft landing light and likely heading to either GSP or GMU airports near Greenville, SC. I didn't give it much thought but glanced at it every 20-30 seconds expecting it to likely cross my path overhead. It didn't seem to be changing position or getting any closer after a few minutes so I started to think that it might be further away than I had thought it to be and coming straight at me. I started to watch it for longer periods of time to try and determine a relative motion. I also noticed that the \"landing\" light appeared to be larger than a normal general aviation aircraft landing light would look like at night from 10-15 miles out. I looked away for a couple of seconds to say something to my wife. As I returned to watching the \"aircraft\" the light went out within a few seconds after. No filament fade out, it just instantaneously vanished. It was then that I noticed no strobe or position lighting remaining at all. This was a totally clear night. All aircraft have to have their lights on especially at night and no pilot would ever purposefully turn off all of their lights in the air! I must have uttered a comment to my self.

The craft consisted of three drone-like fans with a central dome, almost looking like clover.  The light that was extremely intense.  It was a white LED- like a light that lit up the entire neighborhood. It switched to a red light that made the entire neighborhood red almost looking like it was daytime.  Made a light buzzing sound.

We just arrived about 12 miles up the beach from the beach entrance to camp at around midnight so we could meet friends in the morning at our favorite spot and avoid morning beach traffic from Houston where we lived at the time. \nA flashing light was in the rear view mirror just as we parked. The area behind us was swamp so it couldn't be a land vehicle that was approaching us and it seemed to be blinking at that distance. I scrambled for my camera when it became clear that it was something tumbling toward us but I only had daytime 100 ASA film in my 35mm Nikon. \nAs I looked up from the van, I saw what was an oblong, still silent craft covered entirely with triangular windows and thin black frames around them as it slowly tumbled with no visable means of propulsion or wings, it never made a sound and always maintained the same distance from the ground. It was about two telephone poles off the ground and stood about two telephone polls in height which was easy to determine since there were telephone poles to compare to. \nRoughly football shaped, each window was back lit with a different soft pastel color. As it came over the power lines nearly directly above us it took a sharp 90 degree turn, tumbling only in the direction it was traveling and followed the power lines up the beach northward and disappeared into the distance. It was literally a stones throw from me. \nWe scrambled out to see what would happen next and nothing further took place. BUT! The next morning when it was about to become noon after our friends arrived, we were to go to 7-11. I joked about the UFO sucking the battery dry when the van wouldn't start. My friend said there was a flashlight with new batteries in the glove box and sure enough the flash light batteries were drained too!  Really creeped us out but it was awesome at the same time. \nOver the years I've shared my experience with friends and received awe, and at times skepticism, but it's always been important to me to come forward. One friend who was a UFO buff said that my description only represented about ten percent of all sightings he had read about and that never had anyone been that close to this particular type of craft. Cigar and saucer shapes were far more common. \nI still have a sketch of it I made the following day after I returned home.

At first I thought it may have been a plane flying in my direction at an extremely low altitude. Then the object began to descend straight down, a small but noticeable distance, and continue to hover over the residential area of Reseda. I turned to by boyfriend in the passenger seat and told him I knew what I was looking at.\nAt this time a freeway sound wall blocked our view while I was driving in the inside lane. I quickly shifted to the fast lane and waited for the object to come back into view. The object had to be relatively low in the sky if the sound wall and tree tops could easily block our view. When the object was visible again, all the bright lights had been shut off and now the craft’s anti-collision/beacon lights were blinking, and I could clearly see the outline of the unit under the full moon. Disk shaped, with a protruding top and bottom, with the blinking lights arranged around the widest part of the craft. It looked as though it was made of dark grey metal since it was reflective in the moonlight.\nWe had driven around the craft, proving that it was stationary, and decided to circle back to get another look. In the 2 minutes that I was able to circle around back to the craft’s original location, it had moved higher up in the sky and less than a half mile west. We followed the craft by street and observed it, now stationary again, for 15 to 20 minutes. Every now and then we would see the lights on the craft dim and brighten, then descend straight down and hover. On the crafts ”low-light” setting; I could see multiple colored lights blinking at different times. When it began to move further west, we followed again until it was just a small speck in the sky. We decided to finish our errand in Reseda and head home.\nWe were now driving on the 101 southbound through Studio City, California at about 9pm when I looked up and saw another similar-looking craft with bright lights hovering over the freeway a little higher than the treetops. As soon as I pointed in its direction, the craft took off heading north over my vehicle. Again, we turned around to head north and follow but the craft had traveled a considerable distance and we decided it was too far.\nI believe that I may have witnessed two separate spacecrafts. It is also possible that it was the exact same craft that I saw in two different locations when considering its speed capabilities and the time in between spotting the craft(s).","Lights on object":true,"Aura or haze around object":null,"Aircraft nearby":null,"Animals reacted":null,"Left a trail":null,"Emitted other objects":null,"Changed Colo":true,"Emitted beams":null,"Location details":null,"Changed Color":null,"Electrical or magnetic effects":null,"Explanation":null,"Possible abduction":null,"Missing Time":null,"Marks found on body afterwards":null,"Landed":null},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":42,"row":{"Sighting":91148,"Occurred":"2012-07-23 22:41:00 Local","Location":"Lakeside, CA, USA","Shape":"Light","Duration":"33 seconds","No of observers":1.0,"Reported":"2012-07-24 15:53:22 Pacific","Posted":"2012-08-05 00:00:00","Summary":"UFO travelled much faster covering greater distance across sky than conventional crafts in area.","Text":"While on security guard patrol inside fenced-in locked industrial compound,sitting in private vehicle facing South, noticed aerial light to my left moving from East to West.

Also became aware that object displayed no blinking lights always displayed by other conventional craft. Sometimes cannot see blinking lights on our crafts until looking very attentively. I watched this thing carefully but saw none. Compared conventional crafts high in the sky with the object,and they moved quite slow in comparison.

The sky was clear, we could see commercial aircraft about, there was no immediate light pollution and the moon was sharply defined. \nAt 22.50 I got out of the car to took a photo with my 5 megapixels digital camera.  It was shakey (I was cold and tired but didn’t want to miss the eclipse) but there was a clear red point below the moon and a little to the right.  I thought it must be a glitch, so I took several more photos (all shakey but with same red point) then I was too cold and got back in the car. \nWe watched the rest of the eclipse thru’ the (murky!) windscreen.  Because I was sure it was a camera glitch, I didn’t scan the sky for the dot - all my attention was on the eclipse.  \nWhen I looked at the photos on the PC, I found I couldn’t put the red point down to a problem with the camera, however I played about with the photos (using very basic Kodak software).  Other blips were obviously just blips, but this one appears spherical and holds up as that under zoom.  When I saw the Puget Sound photo, it looked to me just the same.  If it is a glitch with the camera, I apologise now - I have taken more photos of the night sky and have been unable to reproduce the red point and it wasn’t on an earlier photo taken of the moonrise. \nMy husband has looked at the photos and thinks I caught something real on the shots.

May 1987\nShape: Cigar | Duration: Undisclosed\nSource: MUFON\nI was working on a rock crusher at the time of this event. I was facing west with the sun behind my back. The crusher had not yet been fired up so there was no noise from the machinery and the only noise was coming from the highway and even that was just the sound of distant passing cars. I looked up as I heard the sound of a low flying jet and saw a jet liner that must have been coming out of Casper. It was only a thousand feet or so up as I could make out the piping on the plane ( red - must have been a WESTERN flight) and I could even make out the individual windows. I have seen a few flights come out of Casper at around that altitude. As the Airliner continued to move ( it was going on a SE course - I assumed toward Denver) Another object appeared below and to the rear of the Airliner. At first I thought that it must be some sort of Towed blimp. My logic for that was that It was a seamless craft and obviously made of Metal ...it was glinting in the sunlight as did some of the parts of the Airliner. This object made NO noise ( the Airliner did) This object had no identifiable doors or windows and it appeared to be about 3/4 of the length of the airliner it was following. It was only slightly thinner than the Airliner. After the first minute or so of watching the event before me I discarded the idea that the object was a blimp..or even another aircraft. It was following the Airliner maybe 500 feet below.. and 500 feet behind.. It moved in perfect unison with the jet as though it was tethered by a iron bar. Where as I could clearly make out the details of the Airliner ( Wings- piping-windows- noise) the object had none of these. It appeared to be a metal cigar shaped craft with (No windows - No Doors or seams - No paint or logo - No Wings or Engines- and No noise). The Airliner and the object continued past my position and flew directly across two roadways..Ther first a minor two lane highway and then another mile and a half further it crossed the I-25 interstate and kept going till it was beyond the horizon and my ability to observe it further.The entire sighting lasted perhaps 4 minutes.

It is a very twisty winding road for just a few miles to the lake.  About a mile before we got to the lake, my son, sitting in the front passenger seat, said “dad, is that a full moon out?”  I leaned over to look and saw a brilliant white light about a quarter mile away across a canyon and behind the trees on the ridge.  I thought it must be a full moon and told my son “looks like it” and kept driving not thinking anything else about it.  Around a minute later, we turned to go across the small dam at the lake, drove maybe 100 yards and almost hit my friend Frank who was walking fast towards us in the middle of the road.  I stopped fast, and could tell something was wrong.  Franks eyes were wide open, and he was yelling something before I could even roll my window down to ask him what he was doing in the middle of the road.  The first thing I heard him yelling was “Did you see it?  Did you see it?  Did you see the F***ing light?”  I had known Frank about 7 years at that time, and had never seen him act anything like this before.  I shut off my engine, and turned off the lights on my jeep, got out and said “What light?  I saw the full moon.....”  I looked up to see the full moon, but it was a moonless night.\nJust then, Frank said “LOOK…….there it is”.  That’s when we all 3 saw it going away from us, going slightly right to left through Long Valley, just North of the lake we were standing at.  It was silent, and very bright white.  It moved slowly, perhaps 10 MPH about 100 feet above the ground lighting up the surrounding hills as it moved along.  From there it just moved towards the West and within a few minutes was gone.\nCatfishing was good that night after all.\nFrank told us that it was a ring of lights, some different colored ones, and mostly white lights all around the circle, and came across the lake towards him with the circle or ring standing vertically, and made absolutely no sound.  He was talking very fast and very excited about it all night, which is not like him at all.\nWitness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My wife and I were waiting to park in our garage.  One of our kids had parked blocking our entrance.   As we waited our car faced South-East so that we could pull in as soon as the other car was moved.\nDuring the time we waited, we noticed two orange orbs in the night sky facing us that looked to be roughly 10 miles off toward downtown Indianapolis.  The orbs were initially horizontal to one another, and had a slight shimmer.  At first we thought these might be helicopters or a military operation but the orbs were not moving any closer. Rather as we continued observation for the next minute or so, we saw the orb on the right make a sudden dip to a vertical formation.  The orb on top did not change position.  The orb on the bottom switched back to the horizontal formation and the vertical a couple more times. These were fast sharp movements that did not resemble a helicopter.  The orb that moved started to get closed to the other orb and was started to move behind the other orb.\nAt this point, our daughter signaled us and moved her car.  We pulled into the garage, all the while keeping an eye on the orbs until we crossed the threshold into the garage. In the span of maybe 10 seconds that it took for us to park, and walk back out to the driveway the orbs has vanished.   I would not expect a helicopter or other conventional craft to simply vanish.","Lights on object":null,"Aura or haze around object":true,"Aircraft nearby":null,"Animals reacted":null,"Left a trail":null,"Emitted other objects":null,"Changed Colo":null,"Emitted beams":null,"Location details":null,"Changed Color":null,"Electrical or magnetic effects":null,"Explanation":null,"Possible abduction":null,"Missing Time":null,"Marks found on body afterwards":null,"Landed":null},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":93,"row":{"Sighting":162149,"Occurred":"2019-08-23 22:00:00 Local","Location":"Wallingford, CT, USA","Shape":null,"Duration":null,"No of observers":0.0,"Reported":"2021-02-20 11:38:51 Pacific","Posted":"2021-03-02 00:00:00","Summary":"MADAR Node 139","Text":null,"Lights on object":null,"Aura or haze around object":null,"Aircraft nearby":null,"Animals reacted":null,"Left a trail":null,"Emitted other objects":null,"Changed Colo":null,"Emitted beams":null,"Location details":null,"Changed Color":null,"Electrical or magnetic effects":null,"Explanation":null,"Possible abduction":null,"Missing Time":null,"Marks found on body afterwards":null,"Landed":null},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":94,"row":{"Sighting":160544,"Occurred":"2020-06-02 21:00:00 Local","Location":"Poca, WV, USA","Shape":"Circle","Duration":"All night","No of observers":6.0,"Reported":"2020-11-09 19:43:46 Pacific","Posted":"2020-12-23 00:00:00","Summary":"Lights and flashes in the sky with interaction every night since the spring of 2020.","Text":"It all started in the spring of 2020. All together I have had 100s of sightings and have had multiple interactions. I've also have had plenty of witnesses; which includes a high ranking officer in the Air Force.  Some of the UFOs I've seen are fireballs; but mostly different colors of light.. round. The interactions I have are flashes of light back and forth.  If I flicker a lighter or flashlight most usually they respond.\nOne sighting I've seen with my girlfriend was one of the craziest I've ever seen. We were sitting on the back porch looking for any sign of a UFO because the night before we were seeing them all over. All of a sudden over the mountain in front of our house; huge balls of light (couldn't see an actual craft because they were so bright) one by one you could see them coming right over top of us. My girlfriend had our kids and was so scared she wanted to go in the house. The were flying in a straight line (no it was Starlink.. I've seen those satellites.. twice) and as they passed the tree in the back yard where we were they disappeared one by one into thin air. There was about 30 of them round about. It's like they left the realm of Earth or something. Very strange thing.. I don't think I'll ever see anything like that again.\nSomething that is strange to me is that every since I have been seeing these UFOs ; I've also have been seeing military planes, drones, and helicopters. As the military planes came in the sightings have dwendeld down. It's hit or miss when I go out to see them, but almost every night I see at least a flash in the sky or what I call cruisers that just cruise thru the night sky then eventually disappear or zip off.\nI am a true believer and have seen it with my own eyes. There is a lot more I could tell but I would need much more time. I'm just glad I get to share my story with other people that have seen them too. I think it's also great that there is a team of people interested in what the government is hiding from us.
